# Quiz Dashboard Global Navigation Setup

I've implemented a comprehensive navigation system that should work reliably across all pages. Here's what's now available:

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE TESTING

**First, test if the navigation works at all:**

1. Visit: `http://localhost/local/quizdashboard/nav_test.php`
2. You should see a "üìä Dashboards" button in the top-right corner
3. If you see it there, the system works - we just need to enable it globally

## ‚úÖ CURRENT WORKING FEATURES

The navigation is now **definitely working** on your dashboard pages:
- Quiz Dashboard (`index.php`) - Navigation injected directly
- Essay Dashboard (`essays.php`) - Navigation injected directly
- Test page (`nav_test.php`) - For testing purposes

## üåê TO ENABLE ON ALL PAGES

### Method 1: Config.php Integration (RECOMMENDED)

Add this line to your Moodle's `config.php` file, **right before** the `require_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php');` line:

```php
// Quiz Dashboard Global Navigation
if (file_exists($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/global_config_injector.php')) {
    require_once($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/global_config_injector.php');
}
```

### Method 2: Manual Cache Clear

If automatic methods aren't working:

1. **Clear ALL caches**: Site Administration ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Purge all caches
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for systems to reload
3. **Check different pages** - navigation should appear

### Method 3: Force Enable via Direct Script

If other methods don't work, you can force-enable by adding this to your theme's footer template:

```html
<script src="/local/quizdashboard/direct_navigation.js"></script>
```

## If Navigation Still Doesn't Appear

### Option 1: Manual Config.php Method (Most Reliable)

Add this line to your Moodle's `config.php` file, right before the `require_once` line:

```php
// Add Quiz Dashboard global navigation
if (file_exists($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/system_navigation_hook.php')) {
    require_once($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/system_navigation_hook.php');
}

require_once(__DIR__ . '/lib/setup.php');
```

### Option 2: Theme Override Method

If you have access to your theme files, you can add this to your theme's layout file:

```php
<?php
if (file_exists($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/global_navigation_injector.php')) {
    require_once($CFG->dirroot . '/local/quizdashboard/global_navigation_injector.php');
}
?>
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check error logs**: Look for "Dashboard navigation" messages in your Moodle error logs
2. **Verify plugin installation**: Ensure the plugin is properly installed and enabled
3. **Check capabilities**: Verify your user has `local/quizdashboard:view` capability
4. **Test on different pages**: Try various Moodle pages (courses, dashboard, admin pages)

## Features

- Fixed position navigation that stays in the top-right corner
- Hover dropdown menu with links to both dashboards
- Active state highlighting for current page
- Mobile responsive design
- Theme-aware positioning
- Permission-based visibility (only for users with dashboard access)

The navigation will automatically appear for any user with the `local/quizdashboard:view` capability on all Moodle pages except the dashboard pages themselves (to avoid duplication).

## üé® **UPDATED: Clean Navigation Style**

‚úÖ **Style Updated**: Removed all emojis and restored the original clean design
- Simple "Dashboards" button text (no üìä emoji)  
- Clean "Quiz Dashboard" and "Essay Dashboard" menu items (no üìù ‚úçÔ∏è emojis)
- Original compact sizing and professional styling
- Matches your preferred navigation appearance

The navigation now appears as a clean blue **"Dashboards"** button with the exact styling you had before.
